        for created textures when possible, which can save memory because some small textures
        may get their alignment 4K and their size a multiply of 4K instead of 64K.

        #define D3D12MA_USE_SMALL_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT 0
            Disables small texture alignment.
        #define D3D12MA_USE_SMALL_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT 1
            Enables conservative algorithm that will use small alignment only for some textures
            that are surely known to support it.
        #define D3D12MA_USE_SMALL_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT 2
            Enables query for small alignment to D3D12 (based on Microsoft sample) which will
            enable small alignment for more textures, but will also generate D3D Debug Layer
            error #721 on call to ID3D12Device::GetResourceAllocationInfo, which you should just
            ignore.
